# CybersecurityWeek9
This is my assignment for week 9 of Cybersecurity

I deployed the mhn-honeypot-1 honeypot. I did that by following the guide from Codepath. 

I had a few issues, the first being I forgot to use port 80, but I was able to fix that by going into the GCloud browser and enabling http under the Firewall option. I also had issues exporting the session.json file but was able to change the command to get it to work.

As of 8:50am I had 3,564 attacks in the last 24 hours. 

I don't completely understand the data collected, I thought I would actually see malware code if I collected any. 

The following are my screenshots showing the steps I took to set up the honeypot and attack it.
